# textemplate
This is a very minimal working latex template that I personally aspire to use while writing project reports for university
This example uses subfiles for inputting files and creating a nice structure and it uses bibtex for the bibliography.

A very big thanks to <a href=github.com/lybech>Stian Lybech</a> for the aautitleblad.sty package, which made the creation of the titelpages very very straight forward and pretty.
